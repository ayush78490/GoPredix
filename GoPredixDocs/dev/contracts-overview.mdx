# Smart Contracts Overview

PreDix uses Solidity smart contracts on BSC for all on chain operations.

## Architecture

### Core Contracts

**MarketFactory**
- Deploys new market contracts
- Manages market registry
- Handles market parameters

**Market (Per Market)**
- Manages individual market
- Handles trading logic
- Manages liquidity pools
- Settles outcomes

**Settlement**
- Determines winning outcomes
- Distributes rewards
- Manages oracle integration

**RewardToken (GPX)**
- Governance token
- Staking mechanism
- Reward distribution

## Key Features

### Non Custodial

- Users control private keys
- Smart contracts manage funds
- No central authority needed

### Transparent

- All transactions on blockchain
- Verifiable outcomes
- Immutable records

### Composable

- Open APIs
- Integration ready
- DeFi compatible

## Main Functions

### Market Creation

```solidity
function createMarket(
  string memory question,
  string[] memory outcomes,
  uint256 deadline
) public payable returns (address)
```

### Trading

```solidity
function buyShares(
  uint256 outcomeId,
  uint256 amount,
  uint256 maxPrice
) public payable
```

### Settlement

```solidity
function settle(uint256 winningOutcomeId) external
```

## Contract Addresses
