# Account Security

Protect your GoPreDix account and funds with best security practices.

## Wallet Security

Your wallet is the most critical part. Secure it first!

### Private Key Protection

- ✅ **Never share** your private key
- ✅ **Never** send to anyone
- ✅ **Never** type into websites
- ✅ **Never** screenshot or email it

MetaMask secures your private key. You should never see it (and don't need it).

### Seed Phrase

Your seed phrase (12 or 24 words) can recreate your wallet.

#### Protect It

1. **Write it down** - On paper, not digitally
2. **Store safely** - Safe, vault, or locked drawer
3. **Multiple copies** - Keep backups in multiple locations
4. **Keep secret** - Tell no one
5. **Test recovery** - (Advanced users only)

<Warning>
Anyone with your seed phrase can steal all your funds. Guard it like your life depends on it!
</Warning>

### Import Protection

If someone gets your seed phrase, they can import your wallet:

**Protect against:**
- Phishing emails asking for seed phrase
- Fake websites requesting seed phrase
- Social engineering
- Device compromise

**Remember:** We NEVER ask for seed phrases

## MetaMask Security

### Password Strength

Create a strong password for MetaMask:

- ✅ **12+ characters** minimum
- ✅ **Mix case** (uppercase + lowercase)
- ✅ **Numbers** included
- ✅ **Symbols** included (@, $, !, etc.)
- ✅ **Unique** (don't reuse)
- ✅ **No personal info** (name, birthdate)

Bad password: `password123`
Good password: `P@ssw0rd!GoPreDix2025`

### Device Security

#### Browser

- ✅ Keep browser updated
- ✅ Enable auto-updates
- ✅ Clear cache regularly
- ✅ Scan for malware
- ✅ Remove suspicious extensions

#### Computer

- ✅ Use antivirus software
- ✅ Keep OS updated
- ✅ Enable firewall

- ❌ Requests for seed phrase
- ❌ Requests for private key
- ❌ Too-good-to-be-true offers
- ❌ Urgent action required messages

### Verify Legitimacy

Always check:
1. **Email domain** - must be @gopredix.com (not @gopredix.co)
2. **URL** - should be app.gopredix.com (not appgopredix.com)
3. **Official channels** - ask in Discord if unsure
4. **Hover links** - check where they go

### Report Phishing

Found phishing?
1. Don't click any links
2. Screenshot it
