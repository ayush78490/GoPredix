# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is GoPreDix?
GoPreDix is a decentralized prediction market platform built on blockchain (BSC). Users can create markets, trade predictions, and earn rewards.

### How does it work?
1. Users create markets with questions (e.g., "Will BTC reach $100k?")
2. Other users buy/sell shares of outcomes
3. When the deadline is reached, the outcome is determined
4. Winners receive their rewards

### Is it safe?
Yes! All data is stored on blockchain (immutable). Your funds are controlled by your MetaMask wallet (non-custodial). No central server can be hacked.

### Do I need crypto experience?
No! If you can use MetaMask, you can use GoPreDix. We have guides for beginners.
