# Using GoPreDix

Master the basics of trading predictions on GoPreDix.

## Quick Overview

### What Can You Do?

2. **Create Markets** - Launch your own market
3. **Trade Predictions** - Buy and sell shares of outcomes
4. **Monitor Portfolio** - Track your positions
5. **Claim Rewards** - Get paid when you win

## How Markets Work

### Market Structure

Every market has:

- **Question** - What you are predicting (e.g., "Will BTC reach $100k?")
- **Outcomes** - Possible answers (e.g., "Yes" or "No")
- **Deadline** - When voting closes
- **Prices** - Current probability of each outcome
- **Creator** - Who made the market
- **Volume** - Total trading activity

### Example Market

```
Question: "Will BTC reach $100k by December 2025?"
Outcomes: ["Yes", "No"]
Current Prices: ["0.65", "0.35"]  (65% probability for "Yes")
Deadline: December 31, 2025 at 11:59 PM
Volume: $500,000
```

## Understanding Prices

### What Prices Mean

Prices represent **probability**:

- **Price 0.70** equals 70 percent probability
- **Price 0.50** equals 50 percent probability  
- **Price 0.30** equals 30 percent probability

### How Prices Change

Prices adjust based on trading:

- **More buying** results in price increases
- **More selling** results in price decreases
- **Balanced** activity keeps price stable

### Price as Your Opportunity

If you think actual probability differs from market price:

- **Market says 30 percent, you think 50 percent** - Buy (potential profit!)
- **Market says 70 percent, you think 40 percent** - Sell short
