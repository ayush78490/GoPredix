# Claim Your Rewards

Learn how to settle markets and claim your winnings.

## How Settlement Works

### Market Lifecycle

1. **Active** - Market is trading (you can buy and sell)
2. **Locked** - Deadline reached (no more trading)
3. **Resolving** - Oracle determines outcome (5 to 60 minutes)
4. **Resolved** - Outcome final (winners can claim)

### Settlement Timeline

```
Days 1 to 10: Market trades
Day 11: Deadline reached then Locked
Day 11: Oracle determines outcome then Resolving
Day 11 to 12: Outcome confirmed then Resolved
Day 12 plus: You can claim rewards
```

## Early Exit Strategy

### Book Profits Before Settlement

You do not have to wait until settlement!

**Option 1: Book Profits Anytime**

You can sell your shares at any time while market is active:
- See price is higher than entry
- Lock in your gains immediately
- Do not wait for market to resolve
- Take profit instantly

**Example:**

```
You buy: 100 shares at 0.50 equals 50 BNB
Market price rises to 0.70
You sell immediately: 100 shares at 0.70 equals 70 BNB
Profit: 20 BNB
No need to hold until settlement!
```

### Cut Losses Anytime

Stop loss protection available anytime:
- Price drops below your comfort level
- Sell immediately to limit losses
- Exit before it drops further
- Preserve remaining capital

**Example:**

```
You buy: 100 shares at 0.60 equals 60 BNB
Market sentiment changes
Price drops to 0.40
You sell immediately: 100 shares at 0.40 equals 40 BNB
Loss: 20 BNB (limited your damage)
Instead of holding and losing even more
```

### Flexible Trading Strategy

Take advantage of market movements:

```
Scenario 1: Price goes up quickly
- Sell immediately and book profits
- Do not wait for final settlement
- Lock in gains while winning

Scenario 2: Price goes down
- Sell and cut losses
- Move capital to better opportunity
- Do not wait for final loss

Scenario 3: Price stabilizes
- Hold until settlement for full payout
- Or sell for partial profit
- Your choice anytime
```

## Claiming Rewards at Settlement

2. Filter: **"Resolved Markets"**
3. See your settled positions
4. See if you won or lost

### Example Settlement

```
Position: 100 shares of "Yes" at 0.50 equals 50 BNB invested

Your Reward: 100 shares × 1.00 equals 100 BNB
Profit: 100 minus 50 equals 50 BNB
Return: 100 percent gain
```

## Early Exit vs Settlement

### Comparison Table

| Scenario | Book Profit | Wait for Settlement |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Price up 30 percent | Sell now, lock gains | Hope it stays up |
| Price down 20 percent | Sell now, cut loss | Hope it recovers |
| Price stable | Hold for more | Claim at deadline |
| Urgent need for funds | Sell anytime | Must wait |
| Confident in outcome | Hold to settlement | Get full payout |

## Losing Positions

### What Happens

If outcome you bought does not win:
- Your shares become worthless
- You lose your entire investment
- But loss is limited to initial investment

### Example Loss

```
Position: 100 shares of "Yes" at 0.50 equals 50 BNB

Market resolves: "No" wins!

Result: You lost 50 BNB
Shares now worthless
Nothing to claim
```

### Cut Loss Early

Do not wait for settlement if losing:

```
You buy 100 shares at 0.50 equals 50 BNB
Price drops to 0.30 (you are down 40 percent)

Option A: Hold to settlement and lose everything
Option B: Sell now at 0.30, recover 30 BNB, lose only 20 BNB

Better to exit early than hold to total loss!
```

## Stop Loss and Take Profit

### Automatic Exit Strategy

Plan your exit before entering:

```
Entry Price: 0.50

Take Profit Target: 0.65 (30 percent gain)
- When price hits 0.65, sell and book profit
- Do not be greedy, lock gains

Stop Loss Target: 0.40 (20 percent loss)
- If price drops to 0.40, sell and cut loss
- Limit damage, preserve capital
```

### Manual Monitoring

Check your positions regularly:
- See current price
- Compare to entry price
- Decide to book profit or cut loss
- Sell anytime you want

### Setting Alerts

Track without constant checking:
1. Set price alert at 0.65 (profit target)
2. Set price alert at 0.40 (loss limit)
3. Get notification when price hits
4. Manually sell when notified

## Partial Exits

### Sell Some, Keep Some

You can sell partial positions:

```
Original Position: 100 shares

Sell Strategy:
- Sell 50 shares at 0.60 (book half profit)
- Keep 50 shares (ride rest of the wave)
- If price rises more, sell rest higher
- If price drops, already locked in gains
- Best of both worlds
```

### Scaling Out Example

```
Entry: Buy 100 shares at 0.50

Price Target 1: 0.60 - Sell 30 shares (lock 10 BNB profit)
Price Target 2: 0.70 - Sell 40 shares (lock 20 BNB profit)
Price Target 3: 0.80 - Sell 30 shares (lock 30 BNB profit)

Result: Locked in profits at different levels
Maximized gains from entire move
```
