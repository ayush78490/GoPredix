### Example Trade

```
Market: "Will BTC reach $100k?"
Outcome: "Yes"
Current Price: 0.65 (65 percent)
Amount: 100 shares
Cost: 100 × 0.65 = 65 BNB
Slippage: 0.5 percent
Total: approximately 65.33 BNB
```

## Understanding Prices

### Price Mechanics

**Price equals Market Probability**
- Price 0.70 equals 70 percent chance of winning
- Price 0.30 equals 30 percent chance of winning

**Why prices matter:**
- Lower price equals better value
- Higher price equals crowd agrees
- You profit if outcome exceeds entry price

### Slippage

Price impact of your trade:

```
Small buy (1 to 100 shares): less than 0.5 percent slippage
Large buy (1000 plus shares): 1 to 5 percent slippage
Huge buy (10000 plus shares): 5 percent plus slippage
```

**Manage slippage:**
1. Set max slippage tolerance (default 1 percent)
2. Break large trades into smaller ones
3. Buy at off peak hours
4. Check market liquidity first

## Selling Shares

### When to Sell

Reasons to sell:

1. **Take Profit** - Price went up, lock in gains
2. **Cut Loss** - Price went down, limit damage
3. **Rebalance** - Adjust portfolio
4. **Raise Cash** - Need liquidity
5. **Exit Early** - Before market resolves

### How to Sell

**Step 1: Go to Portfolio**
1. Click "Portfolio"
2. See all your positions
3. Find position to sell

**Step 2: Select Position**

   - Current price
   - Current P and L

**Step 3: Sell**

3. See revenue you will get
4. See gas cost

**Step 4: Confirm**

**Step 5: Done**
1. Shares sold
2. Cash received in wallet
3. Position updated

### Sell Example

```
Your Position:
- Entry: 100 shares at 0.50 equals 50 BNB
- Current: Same 100 shares at 0.65 equals 65 BNB
- Unrealized Profit: 15 BNB

Sell 100 shares at 0.65:
- Revenue: 65 BNB
- Profit: 15 BNB (30 percent gain)
- Gas Cost: approximately 0.1 BNB
- Net: approximately 14.9 BNB profit
```

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing

- Start small (10 to 50 shares)
- Do not use all capital
- Diversify across markets
- Keep reserves for gas and opportunities

### Dollar Cost Averaging

Buy over time instead of all at once:

```
Instead of: 1000 shares at once
Try: 100 shares and day for 10 days

Benefits:
- Lower average cost
- Reduced slippage
- Better risk management
- Time to evaluate
```

### Stop Loss

Set a price to exit if wrong:

```
Bought at: 0.50
Stop loss: 0.40 (20 percent loss)

If price drops to 0.40:
- Sell automatically
- Limit losses
- Preserve capital
```

## Monitoring Positions

Track all your positions:
- Share count

### Price Alerts

2. Click "Set Alert"
