PrediX provides a Web3 prediction market where users can create and participate in markets on real-world events through blockchain-connected wallets.

## 2. Eligibility and Restricted Jurisdictions

## 14. Global Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are globally applicable.

Disputes shall first be attempted to be resolved through good-faith negotiation, and if unresolved, through neutral international arbitration in accordance with generally accepted arbitration rules.

You agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such arbitration forums and waive any right to class-action proceedings.
