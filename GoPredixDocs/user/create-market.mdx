## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Navigate to Create

1. Click "Create Market" in navigation
2. Click "Create New Market"
3. Start filling form

### Step 2: Write Clear Question

The question is **critical**. Make it:

- Clear - Easy to understand
- Unambiguous - Only one interpretation
- Objective - Resolvable with facts
- Specific - Include dates and values if needed

**Examples:**

Good:
- "Will BTC close above 100,000 dollars on December 31, 2025?"
- "Will Donald Trump be elected US President in 2028?"
- "Will AI pass Turing Test before 2030?"

Bad:
- "Will BTC go up?" (vague)
- "Is AI good?" (subjective)
- "Will we colonize Mars soon?" (no deadline)

### Step 3: Question Validation

**Important:** After you submit your question, it will be validated by our validator system.

**How Validation Works:**

1. You enter your market question
2. Our validator analyzes the question for:
   - Clarity and ambiguity
   - Objective resolvability
   - Proper formatting
   - No prohibited content
   - Reasonable outcomes

3. Validation results:
   - **Passes:** Green checkmark, question approved
   - **Fails:** Error message, explains why it was rejected
   - **Warning:** Question may be risky or unclear

4. If validation passes, your question will be considered for market creation
5. If validation fails, revise your question and try again

**What Gets Rejected:**
- Questions that are too vague
- Questions that cannot be objectively resolved
- Questions with inappropriate language or content
- Questions that violate platform policies
- Questions that are duplicates of existing markets

**Tips to Pass Validation:**
- Use specific dates and numbers
- Be objective, not subjective
- Include resolution criteria
- Keep language clear and simple
- Avoid ambiguous terms

### Step 4: Define Outcomes

Create 2 to 6 distinct outcomes:

**Binary (Yes and No):**
- "Will it rain tomorrow in NYC?"
- Outcomes: ["Yes", "No"]

**Multiple Choice:**
- "Which team wins Super Bowl 2026?"
- Outcomes: ["Chiefs", "49ers", "Cowboys", "Other"]

**Scalar:**
- "BTC price on Dec 31, 2025?"
- Outcomes: ["Less than 50k", "50k to 100k", "100k to 150k", "Greater than 150k"]

**Rules:**
- Outcomes must be **mutually exclusive** (only one wins)
- Outcomes must be **exhaustive** (one must win)
- Outcomes must be **distinct** (not overlapping)

### Step 5: Set Deadline

When should the market close?

- **Minimum:** 1 hour from now
- **Recommended:** At least 24 hours
- **Maximum:** No limit, but consider when event happens

**Examples:**
- Event happening today equals deadline today evening
- Event next month equals deadline next month
- Ongoing event equals deadline when you think it is resolved

### Step 6: Choose Category

Select the most relevant category:

- **Finance** - Markets, stocks, crypto
- **Sports** - Games, tournaments, seasons
- **Politics** - Elections, laws, policies
- **Technology** - AI, space, science
- **Other** - Anything else

### Step 7: Add Description (Optional)

Help traders understand your market:

**Include:**
- Why this event matters
- Resolution criteria
- Data sources
- Historical context

**Example:**

```
BTC price on December 31, 2025 will be determined by the 
closing price on CoinMarketCap at 11:59 PM UTC. This is based 
on the official spot price, not futures.
```

### Step 8: Set Initial Liquidity (Optional)

Provide starting capital:

- **0 BNB** - Market starts with no liquidity (riskier)
- **0.1 to 1 BNB** - Good starting liquidity
- **1 plus BNB** - High liquidity market

**Benefits of liquidity:**
- Attracts traders
- Better prices
- Smooth trading
- Earn LP fees

### Step 9: Review and Deploy

1. Review all details
2. Check your BNB balance (for gas)
3. Click "Deploy Market"
4. Confirm in wallet
5. Wait 5 to 30 seconds
6. Market created!

## After Creation

### Market Goes Live

Your market appears:
- In markets list
- On your profile
- In search results
- Ready for trading

### Earn Fees

You earn **1 percent of all volume** in your market:

- User buys: 0.5 percent to platform, 0.5 percent to LP
- You earn: 1 percent on that buy

**Example:**

```
10,000 dollars in total volume
equals 1 percent creator fee equals 100 dollars
```

### Monitor Performance

Track your markets:

1. Go to "My Markets"
2. See volume, participants, price action
3. View recent trades
4. Check when it resolves

## Market Resolution

### Avoid Bad Markets

Things that hurt markets:

- No liquidity - Traders avoid

## Earnings Example
